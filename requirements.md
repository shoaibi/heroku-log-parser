# Developer Challenge #
The objective of this challenge is to parse a log file and do some analysis on it. It should be an easy task for anyone with previous experience programming. The challenge must be solved in Ruby, Python, or Javascript.
Sample log can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jjd2blth0mcce2x/sample.log

# Requirements & output #
The log file contains all requests to a server within a specific timeframe. Given the following endpoints:

GET /api/users/{user_id}/count_pending_messages
GET /api/users/{user_id}/get_messages
GET /api/users/{user_id}/get_friends_progress
GET /api/users/{user_id}/get_friends_score
POST /api/users/{user_id}
GET /api/users/{user_id}

Where {user_id} is the id of the user calling the backend.

Write a command line program that outputs a small analysis of the sample log containing at least the following:

For each of the URLs above:

* The number of times the URL was called.
* The mean (average), median and mode of the response time (connect time + service time).
* The "dyno" that responded the most.

The output should just be simple text lines. Note that we want aggregate data for all users, not stats on specific users.
What we are looking for
* Correctness
* Simple, clear, readable code
* Memory efficiency (optional - bonus points)
